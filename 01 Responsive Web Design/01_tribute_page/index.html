          <h2>A Digression About Arthur</h2>
          <p style='text-align: center'><strong>(The important stuff is highlighted in green)</strong></p>
        </header>
        <p>Arthur thought that reading a summary written by someone else instead of reading the writer's work by yourself, is like expecting for someone else to chew your food so that you can swallow it, and I agree. But he also thought that any kind of translation will convey a slightly different meaning, and I agree with that too. Whenever you read a translation, you put yourself in the hands of the translator, and even if the translation is accurate, it might not be as easy to read as the original because of several reasons, but mainly two:</p>
        <p>1. The literal word in the target language might have an additional meaning that the original word lacked (making the sentence confusing in the target language if context is not enough to infer the meaning intended by the translator). For example, when I read a translation in spanish, the author is talking about several people or things in the same paragraph, and somewhere in there the translator chose to use the spanish word 'su', which can mean 'his', 'her', 'its' or 'their'.</p>
        <p>2. Sentence structure can rarely be left as in the original while keeping the same level of readability. Languages in which verbs are clearly distinguised from names allow great flexibility in word order, but when these are translated into English, for example (while trying to keep the same word order), you get a huge mess of a riddle.</p>
        <p>Academic translations tend to suffer both of the above problems (and feel unnatural as well) because often the translator will not paraphrase the author when necessary, because anyone who claims to have a better understanding of the work might come and say that the meaning was changed in the translation, so a literal translation spares the editor and the translator from that, but the fear of screwing up is all the more strange when we consider that even The Bible, with its sacred status plus the barrier of dead languages, still gets many pleasant layman's translations.</p>
        <p>However, a life is not enough to learn German, so a translation will have to suffice. The most famous and easily available translation is from Eric Payne, but it feels very archaic today, and it's kind of a pain to read (pun not intended), while the more recent translation from Richard Aquila and David Carus has a somewhat annoying thing with punctuation, but it's easier to read. Those are the ones I know in English, but there might be other ones. Pick any one you can get your hands on.</p>
        <p>The works of Schopenhauer are not many, but they can get really boring in some parts (as with any philosopher), especially when he talks about some very specific science topics. Just as with any book, try to read everything, but if you have to force too much a certain part, skip it without fear, you won't need it to get the big picture. And <strong>if you were to read just 1 of his works, let it be the 1st tome of Parerga and Paralipomena</strong>. That was the first one I read, and it means a lot to me; reading it was as if Arthur's ghost came back from the dead to give me strength during some of the toughest moments of my life.<strong>He has the ability to convey empathy, to give strength, relief and solace, to teach forgiveness and resignation, all at the same time, while making perfect sense.</strong>Parerga and Paralipomena is supposed to be a complement to his main work ('The World as Will and Representation'), but you don't really need that background to understand most of it, the most significant effect of that background is that you get to see the complement in a slightly different, deeper way. Similarly, Schopenhauer insists that his philosophy is a continuation of Kantian philosophy, and that you need a solid understanding of it to properly understand his main work ('The World as Will and Representation'), but I think that's an exaggeration, but it's advisable to have a general understanding of the conclusions of 'On the Fourfold Root of the Principle of Sufficient Reason' before attempting the main work.</p>
        <p>If you decide to give him a chance, I only ask that you give it to him. Above all, avoid the book 'Schopenhauer: A Very Short Introduction', and Bertrand Russell's self-serving peak display of intellectual dishonesty 'A History of Western Philosophy' (which possibly is the 2nd worst 'History of Philosophy', only superseded by Hegel's). I even advise not to read (as introductory material) the Stanford Encyclopedia of Philosophy because its articles are always harder to read than the original source.<strong>Schopenhauer can be read directly, but if you insist on getting an introduction by someone else, I recommend Anthony Kenny's 'A New History of Western Philosophy, vol. 4: Philosophy in the Modern World', which is an excellent book, and <a id='tribute-link' href='https://iep.utm.edu/schopenh/' hreflang='en' target='_blank'>Arthur's article in the Internet Encyclopedia of Philosophy.</a><strong/>
